                                                          <p>Doug Ross (Square Peg) and Sarah Hutton (The Coca-Cola Company) identified the top 4 disruptions keeping the HR/Finance partnership in organisations awake at night at the FD Surgery Conference in London.</p> 
                                                          <p>Events that continually disrupt are both the biggest single challenge and single biggest opportunity to driving growth.  Doug and Sarah discussed implications on organisations of the gig economy, machine economy, disrupted markets, and non-balance sheet risks including the protection of corporate reputation.  They identified lessons learned and emerging best practices which were of significant interest to the participants at this packed event.</p>
                                                          <p>Furthermore they outlined that events, processes, and the mechanics &amp; dynamics of change are the fundamental building blocks of transformation in the new economy.  Keep an eye out in the future for their new insights on unicorns, zebras, and giraffes as they continue to learn from the high velocity tech world.</p>

														  <blockquote>
														    <p>&quot;Square Peg continues to build its phenomenal reputation for delivering complex, high-stakes, high-speed organisational change on a global scale.

														  <p><strong>About the Avios Project:</strong></p>
														  <ul>
														    <li>Since 1988 Airmiles had existed as a loyalty coalition scheme providing a channel for unsold BA airline seats.  Their challenge was to transformation the organisation from a single market, BA owned business to a global loyalty reward currency, available for BA, Iberia and IAG's strategic partners for frequent flyers and frequent buyers.</li>
														    <li>Known as 2020 this high impact project  involved a complete rethinking of all aspects of the business resulting in the launch of a new brand and the re-platforming of core functions.  independent</li>
														    <li>Square Peg was change consulting partners throughout all stages of the transformation process.</li>

														  <p><img src="../images/ioc-logo-537x109.jpg" width="537" height="109" alt="Institute of Consulting"></p>
														  <p>On 11th October 2012, Square Peg Director, Phoebe Dunn led a joint session of the UK Institute of Consulting, The Chartered Management Institute and British Computer Society in London.  The session was entitled:  Managing Effective Consultancy Relationships.</p>
														  <blockquote>
														    <p>&quot;Consultants! Always borrowing your watch to tell you the time!&quot; &quot;Clients! Always making ridiculous demands and wanting everything yesterday!&quot;   </p>
													      </blockquote>
														  <p>The clich&eacute; of the fraught client-consultant relationship is a common-place: characterised by both sides set on exploiting the other amid barely concealed resentments. Whilst the reality is rarely as bad as the clich&eacute;, stereotypes can still influence behaviour on both sides. This session explored some of the nuances in client-consultant relationships that make them so much more complex &ndash; and potentially valuable - than the clich&eacute;. From due diligence and contracting to managing an assignment and establishing long-term partnerships, we looked at all stages of the consulting-relationship life-cycle and some of the assumptions that underpin them. The consultant relationship is a two-way thing: both the client and the consultant have a responsibility to make it as effective as possible. </p>
														  <p>Phoebe Dunn led an interactive session referring to case studies and participants' own experiences to identify practical ways for both sides to make the most of the relationship. </p>

														  <p><strong>European Finance Director's Strategy Forum, Interlaken, Switzerland, September 13th, 2012</strong></p>
														  <p>Square Peg MD, Doug Ross, addressed the European CFO Conference, Interlaken, Switzerland, September 13th, 2012 on the subject of Finance leaders as strategic change partners.  It's a timely topic because, organisations in all sectors are facing the &quot;change or die&#8223; challenge. Whether it is through necessity to restructure or streamline to survive, or simply to change the culture or processes of the organisation to remain competitive or compliant, success lies in the ability of a business, its leaders, and its workforce to change. So as champions of change, how can financial professionals manage, embed and lead change?   </p>
														  <p>CFOs are regularly leading organisations with burning platforms for change where the need for speed and innovation must be balanced with controls, where gutsy leadership and energy is required to work through adversity and emotional commitment is demanded from everyone concerned. Featuring best practice case studies, insightful research, and practical approaches this seminar will explore the mechanical and dynamic aspects of leading change. </p>
														  <p>Change is a fundamental element of doing business and risk is a fundamental element of change and at the middle is often the FD who has to understand both the collective and personal implications for those involved. <strong><a name="constantinus"></a></strong></p>

														    Growing Business magazine</em></strong><br>
														    The business environment is never static: the most consistent demand on management is the ability to read change trends and adapt the organisation to survive them.  A really good management team will not only survive change, but use it to the organisation's benefit.  Diversification is one way to take advantage of change to grow the business, taking on new products, markets, skills, techniques or facilities.  While this strategy can be risky it has the potential to reward the brave with rapid and expansive business growth.  In this article Doug Ross looks at various diversification strategies, their risks and potential rewards using an amusing parallel with poultry farming and in particular looking at the successes and failures of the diversification strategy of Mrs Tweedy, the famously evil chicken farmer in Aardman Production's hilarious 'Chicken Run' animation film.<br>

													      By their own admission, few leadership teams are doing a good job of leading their organisations through times of change.  Research conducted with 937 senior leaders by the business consultancy Square Peg reveals that 50% of senior management teams can neither plan nor execute&hellip;  Just 8% believe their leaders are &lsquo;fantastic and extremely talented&rsquo; and a shocking 14% are &lsquo;void of any real leadership talent.&rsquo; Fortunately our global survey also delivered a more positive message.  30% of the leadership teams were excellent at both planning a direction/strategy for their organisation and being able to successfully execute it.  The challenge is to identify the 30% that can really make a difference.  The study also revealed a number of practices that differentiate high performing organisations from low performing ones.<br>
